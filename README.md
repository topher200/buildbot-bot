### Running wordy

#### Setup
Set environment vars by filling out a `.env` in this dir. contents:
 * export HUBOT_BUILDBOT_URL_NO_TRAILING_SLASH="https://buildbot.YOUR_SITE.com"
 * export HUBOT_OAUTHPROXY_VAL="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" <- cookie from browser
 * export HUBOT_DEBUG_LOGGING='on'  <--- very verbose!

Set the `oauthproxy` var with the oauth_proxy cookie value in the hubot's redis
brain by calling `hubot buildbot oauth <VAR>`.

#### Running
Run tests with
    $ ./run-tests.sh

You can start wordy locally by running:
    $ bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

Then you can interact with wordy by typing `wordy help`.

    wordy> wordy help
